    summary: |
      I was admitted to Transportation Engineering at Beijing University of Technology in 2021 with the second highest score in my major after
      graduating from Dalian Jiaotong University. While pursuing master’s degree, I have been awarded with the first-class academic scholarship
      and have completed the writing of four SCI papers. I am willing to take responsibilities in works, learn new knowledge, and solve problems
      with a strong spirit of research. I am applying for 24 Fall Ph.D. project, if you are interested on me, please contact me by my 
      email (quyansong@emails.bjut.edu.cn) at any time.

            - Raw traffic flow data and geographical information preprocessing to form inputs and adjacency graphs by Python; Multiple missing
            patterns (random missing, timestamp missing, node missing, and block missing) analysis to stimulate the real scenarios.
            - Spatiotemporal adaptive periodical graph contrast learning (ST-A-PGCL) framework is built to make area-wide traffic prediction
            under multiple missing patterns. ST-A-PGCL can extract the spatiotemporal correlations with graph convolution and temporal dilated
            casual convolution, and defeat the data incompleteness based on periodical graph contrastive learning (PGCL) and periodicities modeling.
